# Twitter-API-News-Sentiments

**Summary**

This project utilized the Twitter API and Vader Sentiment Analyzer to review the sentiment scores of 125 tweets each by CBS News, Fox News, CNN, NY Times, and BBC News. The compound sentiment scores were used to build a scatterplot from the individual tweets and a bar chart of the averages compound scores by each news organization. 

**Key Findings**

1. The Tweet sentiment analysis revealed that all of the news organizations have tweets ranging from negative to positive sentiments. This can be seen on the scatterplot. 

2. Many of the compound scores for the individual tweets are netural. This suggests that the tweets may not have an emotionally charged sentiment or the tweets are too short to provide much accurate analysis. 

3. There is still some variation among the scores of the different news agencies overall. CBS News returned the most negative average compound score of -.16, while NYTimes had the highest at .06. 

**Future Analysis**

For future analysis, it would be interesting to test these scores over a range of dates and see if they vary or remain relatively stable.
